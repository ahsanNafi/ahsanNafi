## 🖥️ Linux Command Line and Server Administration

I have extensive experience working with Linux, both through command-line interface (CLI) and in managing server environments. Some of the tasks and technologies I've worked with include:

### 🔧 Server and Network Management:
- **Raspberry Pi**: Setting up and managing headless Raspberry Pi systems (Raspberry Pi OS) through SSH for various IoT and home automation projects.
- **Server Deployment**: Configuring web servers using **Apache** and **Nginx** to host web applications and databases.
- **Docker**: Containerized application deployment using **Docker** for isolated environments and scalability.
- **Database Management**: Installation, setup, and administration of **PostgreSQL** and **phpMyAdmin** to manage databases on servers.
- **Firewalls and Networking**: Configuring **iptables**, VPNs, and managing network security and port forwarding on Linux servers.

### ⚙️ Command Line Proficiency:
- **File Management**: Efficiently using commands like `grep`, `find`, `rsync`, and `tar` for system maintenance, file backups, and recovery.
- **Process Management**: Monitoring and managing processes with `top`, `htop`, `ps`, and using `cron` jobs for automating server tasks.
- **Shell Scripting**: Writing custom **Bash** scripts to automate repetitive tasks and improve system efficiency.
- **Version Control**: Using **Git** to manage and collaborate on code projects directly from the command line.

### 🌍 Web and Server Technologies:
- **Web Servers**: Hosting applications using **Node.js** and Express.js on Linux, ensuring performance optimization and security hardening.
- **Headless Servers**: Managing headless setups on Raspberry Pi and cloud servers, leveraging SSH for remote administration.
- **SSL/TLS Configuration**: Implementing HTTPS by configuring **Let's Encrypt** certificates for secure web traffic.

I’m continually working on improving my server management skills, exploring **Ansible** for automation, and enhancing my Linux administration knowledge through practical applications and scripting.


## 📚 Studying for CCNA Certification

I’m currently studying for the **Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA)** certification to deepen my knowledge of networking and improve my practical skills in:

- **Routing and Switching**: Understanding how routers and switches operate in complex networks, including configuring and troubleshooting them.
- **Network Protocols**: Learning the fundamentals of networking protocols such as **TCP/IP**, **OSPF**, **EIGRP**, and **BGP**.
- **Network Security**: Gaining skills in securing networks, including configuring firewalls, VPNs, and implementing best practices to safeguard against threats.
- **IP Addressing and Subnetting**: Mastering IP addressing schemes, subnetting, and network design for scalable infrastructures.
- **Wireless Networking**: Studying the setup and configuration of wireless networks and understanding their integration with wired networks.

I'm applying my CCNA knowledge alongside my experience with Linux and server administration to build a strong foundation in network infrastructure.
